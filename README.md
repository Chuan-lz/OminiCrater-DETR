###### Configuration before development

1. xxxxx x.x.x
2. xxxxx x.x.x

###### Installation Steps

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shaojintian/Best_README_template.git
```

This project is developed based on ultralytics.

---

üß™ Experimental Environment:
Python: 3.9

PyTorch: 2.0.0 + CUDA 12.2

Torchvision: 0.14.1 + CUDA 12.2

timm: 0.9.8

mmcv: 2.1.0

mmengine: 0.9.0



1. **Uninstall the `ultralytics` library** completely from your environment by running:  
   ```bash
   pip uninstall ultralytics
   ```  
 

2. **Run the uninstall command again** to confirm it's fully removed. If you see:  
   ```
   WARNING: Skipping ultralytics as it is not installed.
   ```  
   then the library has been completely uninstalled.

3. **Optional**: If you want to use the official CLI provided by the `ultralytics` repo, install the library in "develop" mode by running:  
   ```bash
   python setup.py develop
   ```  
   > ‚úÖ *This step is optional. You can skip it if you don't plan to use the official CLI.*

4. **Install the required packages** using the following command:  
   ```bash
   pip install timm==0.9.8 thop efficientnet_pytorch==0.7.1 einops grad-cam==1.4.8 dill==0.3.6 albumentations==1.3.1 pytorch_wavelets==1.3.0 tidecv PyWavelets -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
   ```

   **If you're using DyHead**, these additional packages are **mandatory**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -U openmim
   mim install mmengine
   mim install "mmcv>=2.0.0"
   ```

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è *If these packages aren't installed properly, DyHead will not function correctly!*

5. During runtime, if you encounter any missing package errors, please install them manually as needed.
